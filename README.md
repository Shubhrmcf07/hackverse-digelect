## Description
**Digilect** is an app based on the *contactless alternative of Elections and Voting procedures.* During the pandemic, one of the activities that could not be held online was India's Elections. We believe that the Elections could be held *digitally through smartphones.* The right amount of verification steps like *fingerprint matching, photo verification, and linkage with the official user database of voter IDs and documents* are possible.
